/**
Problem Statement ðŸ—¼

Human civilization now has its base on another planet called Geekland, all credit goes to Geeklog Gusk.
 There are N communication towers numbered from 0 to N-1 on the whole planet which are connected by M wires,
 each wire connects two different towers,
 more formally ith wire connects connections[i][0] and connections[i] [1] tower. All towers run on 9G technology.

Geeklog Gusk has decided to upgrade the technology of some towers to 10G, the newest and fastest technology ever made.
If tower a is upgraded to 10G, then all towers which are connected to tower a should also be upgraded.
More formally two towers should have the same technology if they are connected.
Geeklog only has enough budget to upgrade atmost X towers. Find a maximum number of towers which can be upgraded.

/*
Time complexity : O(n+m) + O(n*x)
for dfs is O(n+m) , where n is number of nodes in the graph (number of towers)
and m is total number of edges in the graph (number of wires)

for dynamic programming , complexity is O(n*x) , where x is max conversions allowed

total time complexity : O(n+m) + O(n*x)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Space complexity : O(n+m) + O(nx)
for making adjacency list it is O(n+m)
for making dp table it is O(nx)
overall is O(n+m) + O(nx)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4, M = 2, X = 3
connections[ ][ ] = {{1, 2},
{0, 3}}

Output:
2

Explanation:
Either tower 1 and 2 or tower 3 and 4
can be upgraded.

Example
Input:
N = 4, M = 3, X = 3
connections[ ][ ] = {{0, 1},
{1, 2},
{2, 3}}

Output:
0

Example
Input:
N = 12, M = 8, X = 4
connections[ ][ ] = {{0, 1},
{1, 2},
{2, 3},
{3, 4},
{5, 6},
{7, 8},
{9, 10},
{10, 11}}

Output:
4
